This shortening is vegan and contains no soy or canola. It is non-hydrogenated, trans-fat free, and has a rich golden color indicating the presence of antioxidant vitamins A & E naturally found in red palm oil. Unlike other shortening products on the market, Nutiva?s Shortening contains Fair for Life Certified red palm oil, sustainably grown on small farms that have been worked by the same families for several generations. This socially aware and ethical approach to farming assures that Nutiva's red palm kernals are orangutan friendly and do not contribute to rain forest deforestation or habitat destruction. Nutiva processes these responsibly grown and sustainably harvested superfoods using a proprietary cold-filtration process, never hexane or other dangerous chemicals, to remove any strong flavor while retaining the nutrients. This coconut/red palm blend is excellent for baked goods such as flaky pie crusts, wholesome biscuits and tasty cookies that call for a neutral-flavored, dairy-free shortening. No wonder these ancient superfoods are still recognized as a healthful addition to vegetarian, vegan, whole food, paleo, ketogenic, and gluten-free diets. Nutiva was founded in 1999 with a single purpose in mind - to Revolutionize the Way the World Eats. Our role is to produce and promote organic, nutrient dense superfoods that are good for you and good for the planet. Social and environmental responsibility is a core part of Nutiva?s culture and business. From sourcing organic products, to obtaining fair trade certification, to greening our facilities and operations, to funding tree planting at schools in our local community, we are constantly seeking ways to better protect our environment and ensure a better quality of life for employees, customers, and the communities we serve.","- Non GMO   - Organic Superfod   ",https://images.barcodelookup.com/1032/10326095-1.jpg,,,,,LuckyVitamin.com,US,USD,$,4.40,https://www.luckyvitamin.com/p-655279-nutiva-organic-superfood-original-shortening-15-oz?site=google_base,"Thrive Market",US,USD,$,4.99,https://thrivemarket.com/p/nutiva-organic-vegan-shortening,"Vitamin Shoppe",US,USD,$,5.99,https://www.vitaminshoppe.com/p/organic-shortening-coconut-red-palm-15-fl-oz-solid/yr-1050,Vitacost.com,US,USD,$,5.49,http://clickserve.dartsearch.net/link/click?lid=43700049338235428&ds_s_kwgid=58700005420260494&ds_url_v=2&ds_dest_,Walmart,US,USD,$,4.99,https://www.walmart.com/ip/Nutiva-USDA-Certified-Organic-non-GMO-Fair-for-Life-Red-Palm-and-Coconut-Shortening-15-ounce/47910592&intsrc=CATF_4284

It also has a neutral scent and flavor (versus virgin coconut oil which has a light, sweet coconut smell and flavor). This makes it ideal for recipes where a coconut flavor is not desired.

We were rewarded and blessed beyond our expectations, in our discovery of the many traditional products made from the wondrous coconut tree. You are now holding in your hands, the fruits of our long journey. It is our joy to be able to share with you the gifts of these exceptional ingredients. - Leslie and Randy.

Small batches ensure that our raw certified organic vinegar made from this natural sap, is an unheated, enzymatically alive product, naturally aged for 8 months to one year.

Hand harvested wild. Eden Kombu is a wide leaf, deep growing sea vegetable that flourishes in the cold Arctic waters of Japans northernmost island where the best Kombu grows wildly. Eden Kombu is hand harvested and sun dried. We offer only the most tender central part of the leaf because of its mild flavor and pleasing texture. Highly appreciated for its food value and flavor enhancing characteristics, Kombu has been considered a health food for centuries in Asia. Kombu is an essential ingredient in the delicious Japanese noodle broth, dashi, but can be added to any soup or soup stock to enliven it. Stew it with vegetables. Pickle or deep-fry it. Pan or oven roasted and grind to a powder, Kombu makes a tasty and most nourishing table condiment. Sprinkle some on popcorn instead of salt as low-sodium, delicious variation. Product of Japan. Add a small piece to soups, stewed vegetables and grains as they cook. One-half strip added to a pound of dried beans helps to tenderize them as they cook. 2.1 oz (60 g) Clinton, MI 49236 888-424-EDEN 2004 Eden Foods, Inc.",,https://images.barcodelookup.com/1443/14439360-1.jpg,,,,,Vitacost.com,US,USD,$,8.79,http://clickserve.dartsearch.net/link/click?lid=43700049338235428&ds_s_kwgid=58700005420260494&ds_url_v=2&ds_dest_,"Swanson Health Products",US,USD,$,10.07,https://www.swansonvitamins.com/eden-foods-kombu-sea-vegetable-2-1-oz-pkg,"Swanson Health",US,USD,$,10.07,https://www.swansonvitamins.com/eden-foods-kombu-sea-vegetable-2-1-oz-pkg,Walmart,US,USD,$,11.99,https://www.walmart.com/ip/Eden-Foods-Eden-Kombu-2-1-oz/41191887&intsrc=CATF_4287,Rakuten.com,US,USD,$,62.37,https://www.rakuten.com/shop/unbeatablesale/product/BNGLA4716/?sku=BNGLA4716&scid=af_feed

Bernie was Annie's pet Dutch rabbit. When she started the company, Annie chose him to be our official ""rabbit of approval"" representing the simplicity, care, and goodness in all of our products. Dear Friend, My husband Rob and I were the Annie's Consumer Relations and Mail Order team for several years and were accustomed to the phone ringing day and night. If the phone rang at 2:00 AM, it might have been a friend or family member, but more likely it was someone calling to order mac & cheese. Annie's original warehouse was an old grain mill without climate control. Rob and I hand-addressed every mail-ordered case, and during the winter months I often used a hair dryer to keep my fingers nimble. We packed our two-door Volkswagen with up to 50 cases, keeping our tiny post office busy. My connection to our consumers deepened with every case sent during those years; a connection, I believe, is the foundation of Annie's. Bye for now, Annie Yum for Every Bunny!

Ancient Harvest understands that the best traditional mac n cheese is rich, creamy and deliciously cheesy.
